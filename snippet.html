  <h2>Anatomy of an HTML Tag</h2>
  <p> Here is a snippet of code:</p>
  <img src= "snipcode.JPG" >

  <p>Here, the tag 'p' defines the content of a paragraph.
    The text after the first p bracket and before the /p bracket will appear on the user interface.
     This <a href="https://html.com/tags/p/" id=p-tag target="_blank">site</a> provides more detail about the p tag.
     <br>
     The tag 'a' defines a hyperlink. Inside the first bracket are where you'll add internal labels about the hyperlink.
     The text between the two a brackets are what will be hyperlinked.
     This <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp id=a-tag>site</a> provides more detail about the a tag.
    <br><br>
    The tags are nested within in each other. The information within the a tag only applies to that section.
    Anything done within the p tag applies to all of it, including the a tag.
    The a tag would be considered a child of the p tag, and the p tag the parent of the a tag.
    This lineage can continue; there can be multiple children of one parent, a child of a child, and so on.
    <br><br>
    Labels can be added to any part of the code to identify and reference later on.
    In this example, there are labels for the hyperlink. Specifically:
    <ul>
      <li>'href' provides the link</li>
      <li>'id' specifies that line of code</li>
      <li>'class' categorizes it as a banana, there may other members of the banana class elsewhere in the code</li>
      <li>'target' describes how the command should be operated. Here _blank calls for it to be opened in a blank tab</li>
    </ul>
