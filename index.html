  <h1>Coding Guide</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>To get started with coding, you'll need a terminal for your device to carry out commands,
    and a software to write code on. On Windows, you can download GitBash to access terminal,
    and Visual Studio to write your code in
  </p>

  <p>Visual Studio Code</p>

  <p>The terminal allows you to create commands for you device to follow. Open GitBash to access the command line.
    <br>
    The first thing you'll want to do is locate your commands in a file folder.
    To reach a specific file, or directory, type cd and then the name of the directory. Here is an example:
  </p>

  <img src="cd.JPG"> <!--This doesn't work lol (the pic has to be saved in the same directory as this file)-->

  <p> There are a variety of commands to use to navigate directories. In the current location, typing in</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"ls" will list out directories</li>
    <li>"mkdr ___" with a directory name will make a new folder</li>
    <li>"fsutil file createnew __ 0" with a file name will make a new empty file (This is for Windows)</li>
    <li>"code ." will open up the code for the file in VS Code</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a great video to walk you through the command line.</p>
