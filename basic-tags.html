  <h1>Basic Tags</h1>

  <section>
  <h2>Text</h2>
    <h3>Block level:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>p</code> tag allows for text to appear. The desried text should go inside the two <code>p</code> brackets.</li>
      <li>The <code>blockquote</code> tag allows shows citation from another website. Here is an example:</li>
      <img src="block.JPG">
      <!-- //code from https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp  -->
      <li>The <code>pre</code> tag preserves the formatting of the text just as it is entered in the code. The text should be within the brackets, just like the <code>p</code> tag.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Inline styling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>em</code> tag can be used to emphasize certain parts of the text. This shows up as italics in most softwares.</li>
      <li>The <code>i</code> tag formats the text in <i>italics</i>.</li>
      <li>Likewise, the <code>strong</code> tag makes ceratin parts of the text stronger than the rest. This shows up as bold in most softwares.</li>
      <li>The <code>b</code> tag formats the text as <b>bold</b>.</li>
      <blockquote
      cite="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271743/whats-the-difference-between-b-and-strong-i-and-em">
      <code>b</code> is a style - we know what "bold" is supposed to look like. <br>
      <code>strong</code> however is an indication of how something should be understood. "Strong" could (and often does) mean "bold" in a browser, but it could also mean a lower tone for a speaking program like Jaws (for blind people) or be represented by an underline (since you can't bold a bold) on a Palm Pilot.
      </blockquote>
      <li>The `code` tag defines a line of code in the default <code>monospace</code> font.</li>
    </ul>
